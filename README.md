# Adding floTerm to your project
Adding this library to your project is as simple as downloading the `floTerm.h` and `floTerm.c` files
and including `floTerm.h` in your main file. Then you can use the example mains for guidance on how to get started.

# Running floTerm examples
Clone the repository. From the folder, run:

`make build1` or `make build2` to build from main.c or main_2.c in src.
