# floTerm
A simple and intuitive terminal drawing library. Featuring unicode characters and color!

# Planned Additions
I am planning to make this more modular so it can be included in any project that is writing to the
terminal in this way. Since it has no external dependencies, it should be very portable and easy to use
by just importing one header file.
